## Exact vs. Approximate Bayesian Inference
* The most fundamental element in the reconstruction is the Bayesian method of inference (see **_Level 1_**). This specifies how state and observation probabilities can be combined with the conditional probability of the observation given the state, to derive the posterior probability of the state. To this basic foundation is added the concept of _approximate_ Bayesian inference (**_Level 2_**). This is a way of avoiding the difficulties that arise if the number of potential observations is problematically large. The method exploits the degree to which the prediction probability (likelihood × state probability) constrains the observation probability.
* Friston (personal communication) takes the principle to be that ‘all self organizing systems can be read — or interpreted — as performing approximate Bayesian inference by optimizing a variational (free energy) bound on marginal likelihood.’

## Exact vs. Approximate Bayesian Inference
* In the same sense that FREE ENERGY PRINCIPLE (INFERENCE) approximates Bayesian inference, it has been suggested that minimizing expected free energy can be read as an approximation of optimal Bayesian design and Bayesian decision theory.
* Variational inference approximates Bayesian inference by demonstrating that variational free energy takes its lowest value when the true posterior is used.

## Exact vs. Approximate Bayesian Inference
* If $r(η|μ)=p(η,b,μ)$ then it also decomposes and the entire functional, including the surprisal of blanket and internal states, evaluates to zero; this is exact Bayesian inference.
* The key point of this construction is that, given such a partition, under the FEP, we can interpret the autonomous partition of the particular system as engaging in a form of Bayesian inference, the exact form of which depends on additional assumptions made about the kind of sparse coupling and conditional independence structures of the particular system being considered.
* Approximate Bayesian inference: When conditioned on blanket states, the internal states of a self-evidencing system on average perform approximate Bayesian inference on external states, via a minimisation of variational free energy.
* With these assumptions in play, we can derive a stronger version of the claim that particular systems engage in a form of approximate Bayesian inference. This approximate Bayesian inference lemma (ABIL) can be stated as follows: when a system has a steady state solution, we can define a synchronisation map or manifold that systematically relates the conditional mode of external states to that of internal states. Under these conditions, we can say that the particular looks as if it performs inference about an optimal conditional mode, by internally encoding the statistics of the outside environment. The ABIL itself says that under a synchronisation map and a variational free energy functional (or its equivalent), this mode matching is both necessary and sufficient for approximate Bayesian inference.
## An Example of Self-evidencing Interpretation
* It is like saying that things which exist in the universe must obey the laws of physics as fundamental laws—when the wind blows and shakes a tree branch, on one reading, it is because the tree branch has inertia, but not enough to resist the force of the wind; on another, it is because the tree branch reduces its surprisal about the state of the world by modelling it.
